He has a neatly maintained short beard and mustache, natural black hair partially covered by traditional headwear.

He wears historically accurate early Islamic Javanese royal religious clothing from the 1500s ${sultanateEra} period.

${headwearDesc}

Around his shoulders is a long traditional white shawl (selendang) made from fine handwoven Javanese cotton, draped naturally over both shoulders and chest. The fabric has realistic weight, wrinkles, folds, and subtle shadows.

${robeDesc}

${innerDesc}

At his waist he wears a simple traditional leather belt combined with a small cloth sash. A historically accurate Javanese keris is tucked into his waist, featuring an old wooden warangka sheath, aged carved wood texture, traditional ${craftStyle} craftsmanship, and a simple antique appearance suitable for a spiritual leader, not a warrior.

In his right hand he holds an old wooden walking staff made from aged teak wood, with visible natural wood grain, scratches, and handmade craftsmanship. In his other hand he holds a string of traditional wooden tasbih prayer beads made from dark natural seeds or wood, each bead individually crafted.

Additional accessories:
- simple silver ring with traditional Javanese craftsmanship
- small cloth pouch attached to waist for personal items
- traditional woven sandals made from natural fibers
- no luxury jewelry, showing humility and spirituality

The character stands with a peaceful humble posture, representing a respected Islamic teacher, scholar, and spiritual leader of 16th century Java.

Environment:
An authentic 16th century ${backgroundSetting} coastal Java setting, historically accurate to the era of ${nameClean}. Background shows an old wooden Javanese pendopo pavilion made from teak wood, traditional carved wooden pillars, ancient stone floor, tropical coastal vegetation, palm trees, old village atmosphere, soft morning mist, warm natural sunlight.

The architecture must resemble early Demak-Cirebon Sultanate period Java:
traditional wooden structures, carved teak details, clay roof tiles, natural earth textures, no modern buildings.

Lighting:
cinematic natural sunlight, soft golden hour lighting, realistic shadows, atmospheric depth, documentary historical photography style.

full body portrait, 85mm DSLR lens, shallow depth of field, realistic perspective, ultra detailed skin texture, realistic fabric simulation, National Geographic historical documentary photography style.
