MASTERPIECE, SOLO CHARACTER, SINGLE SUBJECT, ONE HISTORICAL PERSON ONLY, CHARACTER FOCUS, FULL BODY HISTORICAL PORTRAIT

Ultra realistic historical portrait of a single Javanese Islamic scholar and Wali figure from the early 16th century, inspired by ${nameClean} during the Cirebon/Demak Sultanate era. One person only, the main character standing alone, no other humans.

The figure is an elderly yet dignified Javanese spiritual leader ${ageStr} years old, with a calm and wise expression, deep thoughtful eyes, gentle face, subtle wrinkles showing age and wisdom, natural Southeast Asian facial features, realistic skin pores, authentic human anatomy. He has a neatly maintained short beard and mustache, natural black hair partially covered by traditional headwear.

He wears historically accurate early Islamic Javanese royal religious clothing from the 1500s Cirebon Sultanate period.

His head is wrapped with a traditional white Javanese turban (iket/turban style), made from handwoven cotton cloth, carefully layered with visible fabric folds, natural creases, slightly uneven handmade texture. The turban looks aged naturally, not modern, with soft cotton fibers visible.

Around his shoulders is a long traditional white shawl (selendang) made from fine handwoven Javanese cotton, draped naturally over both shoulders and chest. The fabric has realistic weight, wrinkles, folds, and subtle shadows.

Underneath he wears a loose long traditional robe (jubah) in light ivory and pale gray tones, inspired by early Islamic scholars in Java. The robe has wide flowing sleeves, handmade stitching, rough woven texture, natural fabric imperfections, and historical simplicity. It is not Middle Eastern desert clothing but a fusion of Javanese and Islamic culture from coastal Java.

His inner clothing consists of a dark traditional Javanese long shirt with subtle woven patterns. Around his waist is a traditional ancient Javanese jarik cloth with authentic 16th century coastal batik motifs, dark earthy colors, handmade wax-resist patterns, wrapped naturally around the body.

At his waist he wears a simple traditional leather belt combined with a small cloth sash. A historically accurate Javanese keris is tucked into his waist, featuring an old wooden warangka sheath, aged carved wood texture, traditional Cirebon craftsmanship, and a simple antique appearance suitable for a spiritual leader, not a warrior.

In his right hand he holds an old wooden walking staff made from aged teak wood, with visible natural wood grain, scratches, and handmade craftsmanship. In his other hand he holds a string of traditional wooden tasbih prayer beads made from dark natural seeds or wood, each bead individually crafted.

Additional accessories:
- simple silver ring with traditional Javanese craftsmanship
- small cloth pouch attached to waist for personal items
- traditional woven sandals made from natural fibers
- no luxury jewelry, showing humility and spirituality

The character stands with a peaceful humble posture, representing a respected Islamic teacher, scholar, and spiritual leader of 16th century Java.

Environment:
An authentic 16th century Cirebon coastal Java setting, historically accurate to the era of Sunan Gunung Jati. Background shows an old wooden Javanese pendopo pavilion made from teak wood, traditional carved wooden pillars, ancient stone floor, tropical coastal vegetation, palm trees, old village atmosphere, soft morning mist, warm natural sunlight.

The architecture must resemble early Demak-Cirebon Sultanate period Java:
traditional wooden structures, carved teak details, clay roof tiles, natural earth textures, no modern buildings.

Lighting:
cinematic natural sunlight, soft golden hour lighting, realistic shadows, atmospheric depth, documentary historical photography style.

Camera:
full body portrait, 85mm DSLR lens, shallow depth of field, realistic perspective, ultra detailed skin texture, realistic fabric simulation, National Geographic historical documentary photography style.

8K resolution, photorealistic, hyper realistic, physically accurate materials, realistic human proportions.

historical reconstruction photography, authentic 1500s Java, Cirebon Sultanate era, museum quality realism`;
